# Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple game of tic tac toe built in Java. 

There are 3 command line arguments (or program arguments if you use eclipse, intelliJ etc..): Size, Empty, and Depth, all of which are integers.

The size corresponds to board size, ie: inputting 3 will give a 3x3 board.

Empty corresponds to the number of tiles on the board that must remain empty. (once the number of empty tiles has been reached, you cannot place any more pieces, you must move your pre-existing pieces in a 1x1 square radius)

Depth refers to the number of recursive calls, and thus the difficulty of the computer player. (I higher depth means a more difficult opponent, however it also means it will take longer for the computer to make its move.)

The empty squares are colored green, the player squares are colored blue, and the computer squares are colored red.
When all of your pieces have been used, selecting an already placed piece will color your piece purple.

I hope you enjoy!
